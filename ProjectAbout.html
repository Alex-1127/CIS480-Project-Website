            <h1>About Paige</h1>
        <p>
            I have coached lacrosse for over 10 years, all levels. Youth, high school, club, and college level players.I have played lacrosse since I was very young, getting my first stick at one years old.
            I played all through middle school, high school, college and now post college so I know all aspects of the game. My special areas of expertise is attack, defense, mid/draw control, and goalie (in that order).
              Lacrosse has let me travel all over the country. I have played and coached in multiple places in New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Illinois, California and even Hawaii.
              I also have coaching and playing at the international level, have travelled to Canada for 3 years.
              Lastly, I have had girls who have played under me go on and play D1, D2, D3 and college club levels.
               Some of them have won championships in their leagues, visited the Final Four, even won the NCAA Division 1 Championship.
             I take pride in my coaching and want my players to succeed, whether itâ€™s at the beginner level, or intermediate level.
