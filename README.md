Project Description:
  Our client, Paige Printup, is requesting a website for her personal training business, Niagara Ladies Lax. We plan to develop a functional website, with the main purpose to be able to allow potential and returning players to schedule private lacrosse practices. Additional features on the website will include a gallery of her coaching work, a review page from past players, a bio page with FAQs, as well as a price estimation for those scheduling appointments. Acceptance criteria will include a successful booking system that sends client-requests to her email, a media gallery that displays photos and videos without errors, a review section that allows for posting and displaying, and an accessible about page that contains all important information. Our constraints include time, which is the remainder of the spring 2025 semester, budget, which is to keep on the low end for our client, and accessibility of the website across all platforms.
